abstract = "El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been identified as one of the main drivers for the interannual variability in eastern African rainfall. But we know little about its direct impact on vegetation and how it might change in the future. In this study, we quantified this relationship and predict its future under certain climate change scenarios. Results suggest that we need to consider an increase in future ENSO intensity to cover the full range of potential changes in vegetation responses."

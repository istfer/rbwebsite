# Current Research

My current research focuses on improving ecosystem models through data assimilation. I am interested in constraining and validating models using a diversity of data types in a Bayesian framework. For this purpose I am using and contributing to development of [PEcAn](http://pecanproject.github.io/) (Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer) which is an ecological bioinformatics toolbox for improving communication between models and data.
